## What It Does

- **🔒 Encrypted** — Messages are scrambled before leaving your device. Only people in the room can read them.
- **💨 Ephemeral** — When the room closes, messages are gone forever. No history, no logs.
- **👤 Anonymous** — No accounts, no emails, no phone numbers. Just pick a nickname and go.
- **🌐 Decentralized** — Uses multiple relay servers. No single company controls your data.

## Privacy & Honesty

**What EnigmaJS does:**
- Encrypts all messages end-to-end
- Creates fresh keys for every room
- Stores nothing — everything is in memory only
- Deletes everything when the room closes

**What EnigmaJS cannot do:**
- Protect you if someone's looking at your screen
- Stop people from taking screenshots
- Verify who you're really talking to (share room codes through trusted channels!)
- Guarantee instant delivery (decentralized networks can have delays)

**About the relay servers:**
Your messages pass through Gun.js relays as encrypted blobs — they can't read them. However, relays could potentially see metadata (your IP address, timestamps, message sizes).

**For better anonymity:**
- Use a VPN
- Use Tor Browser
- Host your own Gun relay
