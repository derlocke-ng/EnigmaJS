# EnigmaJS Changelog

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-18 - Skip Verification for Non-Critical Messages

### Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Skip verification for ping/pong/user-joined** - These non-critical messages (UI updates only) now skip signature verification entirely. Fixes race condition where user-joined arrives before welcome is processed.

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-18 - Heir Secrets Race Fix

### Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fixed heir-secrets race condition** - `heir-secrets` could arrive before `promote-notify` due to Gun.js message ordering. Now accepts secrets from any verified sender (signature verification ensures legitimacy).

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-18 - Heir Secrets

### 🔐 New Feature

- **Password survives host disconnect** - Host now proactively sends encrypted secrets (roomPassword, sharedSecret) to the next-in-line peer. If host disconnects unexpectedly, the heir can take over with password intact.

### Technical Details

- New `heir-secrets` message type with ECDH encryption
- Secrets updated when: peer joins, peer kicked, password changes
- `selfPromote()` uses cached heir secrets if available

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-18 - Race Condition Fix

### Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fixed user-joined verification race condition** - `user-joined` messages could arrive before `welcome` was processed, causing "unknown sender" errors. Now uses lenient verification (verify if known, allow if unknown) like ping/pong messages.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-18 - Security Hardening

### 🔒 Major Security Update

Comprehensive security audit and hardening of the encryption and messaging system.

### Security Improvements

#### Message Authentication (NEW)

- 🔒 **Message Signing** - All messages now cryptographically signed with sender's SEA private key
- 🔒 **Signature Verification** - Recipients verify signatures using sender's public key
- 🔒 **Sender Impersonation Prevention** - Attackers cannot forge messages as other users
- 🔒 **Control Message Protection** - Kick, promote, and rekey messages are now authenticated
- 🔒 **Deterministic JSON Signing** - Sorted keys ensure consistent signatures across Gun.js transport

#### Host Transfer Security (FIXED)

- 🔒 **Encrypted sharedSecret Transfer** - Was sent in PLAINTEXT, now encrypted via ECDH
- 🔒 **Encrypted roomPassword Transfer** - Was sent hashed, now encrypted via ECDH
- 🔒 **Secure Auto-Promote** - Password reset when host leaves (can't securely transfer without old host)

#### Peer Key Management (IMPROVED)

- 🔒 **Peer Keys in Welcome Message** - New joiners receive pub/epub keys of all existing peers
- 🔒 **peerKeys Transfer on Promotion** - New host receives all peer keys for re-keying capability
- 🔒 **ECDH Keys in user-joined** - All peers store keys for potential future host duties

#### Room Key Security (IMPROVED)

- 🔒 **Re-keying After Kick** - Generate new room key and distribute via ECDH to remaining peers
- 🔒 **Key Cleanup on Kick** - Clear sharedSecret, seaKeyPair, peerKeys when kicked
- 🔒 **Stale Peer Cleanup** - Remove timed-out peers before sending peer list to new joiners

### Technical Changes

- Added `signMessage()` method using `SEA.sign(content, seaKeyPair)`
- Added `verifySignature()` method using `SEA.verify(signature, pubKey)`
- Added `getSignableFields()` for deterministic field extraction per message type
- Strict signature verification for security-critical messages (kick, promote, rekey, etc.)
- Lenient verification for ping/pong (allow unknown senders for keepalive)
- Fixed SEA.verify returning parsed object instead of string (stringify for comparison)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed ghost users appearing in user list after host migration
- Fixed peerJoinOrder not cleaned up on kick/kick-notify
- Fixed new joiners unable to verify messages from existing peers (missing keys)
